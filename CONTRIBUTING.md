### Contributing Components

We are currently developing the acceptance criteria for new components.

1. Components should be licenced under the MIT.
2. Component contributions should be accessible, and tested in screenreaders such as NVDA and JAWS.
3. Contributions should adhere to the coding patterns in the Design System (ie, Prettier and naming conventions).

### Contributing examples or documentation fixes

Most documentation is under `packages/govtnz-ds-website/src/docs/` as markdown files with React JSX used for examples (these are converted into examples for each language).

## Development

### Install

A `Development install` is only necessary for contributing components or bug-fixes.

1. Install [`NVM`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation).
2. `nvm install`
3. `yarn` (installs)
4. `yarn build:all` (this may take a while)

Then, under `packages` add components to `govtnz-ds-upstream` and reference them from `govtnz-ds` and the `build-spec.json`.
